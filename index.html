        <h1>Universal Worker: an open source project to automate interactions with your computer</h1>
        <p>This technology revolutionizes the way users interact with their computers by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), Agents using LLMs, reflection, and a suite of tools to create a unified interface. This innovative approach leverages the power of LLMs to understand and process natural language inputs, enabling users to perform a wide range of tasks—from managing emails and accessing files to launching applications—through simple, conversational commands. By harnessing the capabilities of LLM agents, our system not only understands user requests but also anticipates needs, offering suggestions and automating routine tasks to enhance productivity and streamline the computing experience.</p>
        <p>Reflection, a key component of our technology, allows our system to inspect and modify its own structure and behavior dynamically, adapting to the user's changing needs and preferences. This introspective ability, combined with a carefully curated selection of tools, ensures that our interface remains flexible, extensible, and highly customizable. Whether for personal use or within a professional setting, our technology empowers users to interact with their digital environment in more intuitive and efficient ways, transforming the traditional computing experience into one that is more aligned with the natural human way of communicating and problem-solving
